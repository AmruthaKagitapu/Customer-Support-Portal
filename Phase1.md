# Phase 1 — Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

**Project:** Customer Support Portal for Telecom Company (Salesforce Service Cloud)

**Context:** I am a 4th-year student working on this project as part of the TCS Lastmile program and personal skill development. The purpose is not to deliver to an actual client but to simulate a professional project to showcase in my portfolio and enhance future job opportunities. Phase 1 focuses on understanding the business challenges and industry specifics of telecom customer support before starting the Salesforce build.


## 1. Requirement Gathering — learning by simulating

**Goal:** Practice gathering telecom support requirements and translating them into Salesforce Service Cloud features.

### My approach as a student

* Research: Study telecom customer service challenges, best practices, and case management by reading articles, whitepapers, and Salesforce documentation.
* Fictional interviews:Imagine discussions with telecom support managers, agents, and customers based on observed or reported pain points.
* Personal experience: Reflect on any telecom customer service interactions I have experienced or know about.

### What I’ll gather

* Must-have features: customer issue submission portal, automated case assignment, escalation workflows, timely responses.
* Nice-to-have features: self-service knowledge base, case status tracking, customer feedback surveys.
* Pain points: long waiting times, manual case handling, limited personalization,fragmented reporting.


## 2. Stakeholder Analysis — using personas

**Goal:** Simulate key telecom support stakeholders and understand their needs and priorities.

### Example personas

* Customer Persona: wants fast, clear, and personalized support.
* Support Agent Persona: needs manageable workloads and clear case details.
* Support Manager Persona: wants visibility into team performance and rapid escalations.
* IT Admin Persona: desires smooth integration and system reliability.
* Myself (student builder): focused on practicing Salesforce Service Cloud case management, automation, and reporting capabilities.


## 3. Business Process Mapping — as-is vs to-be

**Goal:** Map current telecom customer support workflows and envision an improved Salesforce-based process.

### As-is (imagined from research and experience)
* Customers contact support via calls or emails.
* Support agents manually log and assign cases.
* Escalation handled informally or delayed.
* Managers use spreadsheets or disconnected tools to track metrics.
* Customers have little visibility into their case status.

### To-be (my project design)

* Customer Support Portal for issue submission and real-time tracking.
* Automated case assignment and timely escalation using Salesforce tools.
* Dashboards to monitor support team performance.
* Self-service options to reduce simple requests.


### 4. Industry-specific Use Case Analysis — telecom focus

**Goal:** Understand telecom-specific customer service challenges to tailor solutions accordingly.

### Examples
* Handling large volumes during network outages with priority routing.
* Escalation paths for complex technical or billing issues.
* Multi-channel case creation (phone, portal, social media).
* Complying with regulatory requirements on data privacy.


**How I’ll use this:** Incorporate telecom-specific workflows and considerations in my solution design and documentation.


### 5. AppExchange Exploration — learning exercise

**Goal:** Research Salesforce marketplace apps applicable to customer support portals.

### Apps I’ll look at
* Salesforce Knowledge: articles and FAQ management for self-service.
* Case Capture and Routing Apps: advanced assignment and automation.
* Survey Apps: gather customer feedback post-case.
* Telecom-specific support utilities (if available) for enhanced features.
